                        <h2>Client Background & Context</h2>
                        <p>RPM is a premier logistics partner specializing in orchestrating complex, high-stakes freight movements that standard carriers can't handle. They serve mission-critical industries, particularly automotive and heavy manufacturing, where a single delayed shipment can halt a multi-million-dollar production line. Despite their deep operational expertise, their marketing efforts weren't effectively communicating this value, leaving them competing on price in a market that often commoditizes highly specialized services.</p>

                    <section id="challenge">
                        <h2>The Challenge: When Marketing Doesn't Match Mastery</h2>
                        <p>RPM faced a critical disconnect between their sophisticated services and their lead generation strategy. Their primary business challenges were:</p>
                        <ul class="challenge-list">
                            <li><strong>High Cost Per Lead (CPL):</strong> An over-reliance on paid channels without compelling, educational content meant they were paying a premium for leads that were often unqualified or purely price-shopping.</li>
                            <li><strong>Low Sales Qualified Lead (SQL) Conversion:</strong> The sales team spent valuable time educating prospects who lacked a fundamental understanding of RPM’s value proposition. Leads were not pre-qualified or nurtured, resulting in inefficient sales cycles and low conversion rates.</li>
                            <li><strong>Stagnant Organic Growth:</strong> A lack of substantive, SEO-optimized content limited their online visibility. High-value prospects searching for solutions to complex logistics challenges were not finding them.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These issues created a significant barrier to achieving their aggressive growth targets, putting pressure on both marketing and sales to produce better results without a clear strategy to do so.</p>
                    </section>

                    <!-- The Solution -->
                    <section id="solution">
                        <h2>The Solution: From Lead Generation to Demand Generation</h2>
                        <p>We proposed a strategic shift from chasing leads to attracting qualified buyers by codifying RPM's immense institutional knowledge into high-value content assets. Our solution was built around a multi-phase approach:</p>
                        <img src="https://placehold.co/800x400/010AD1/FFFFFF?text=High-Value+Content+Assets" alt="Placeholder image showing ebook covers" class="content-image">
                        <ol class="solution-list">
                            <li><strong>Vertical-Specific Content Strategy:</strong> We identified RPM's three most critical service areas and developed a deep-dive ebook for each. These weren't brochures; they were executive playbooks designed to help transportation managers solve their most pressing problems.</li>
                            <li><strong>SEO-Driven Landing Page Framework:</strong> Each ebook became the centerpiece of a dedicated, SEO-optimized landing page. We conducted extensive keyword research to ensure the pages would rank for high-intent search terms.</li>
                            <li><strong>Content Repurposing & Amplification:</strong> To maximize the value of the cornerstone ebooks, we repurposed chapters and key concepts into a series of detailed blog posts to multiply RPM's SEO footprint and establish their authority.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>By focusing on educating the market, we aimed to build a sustainable engine that would attract, qualify, and convert the right-fit enterprise clients.</p>
